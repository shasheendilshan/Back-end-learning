# Task: 1 - Create REST API using Express

You have already created a mock API using `json-server` during the Frontend Training program. The goal of this task is to make yourselves familiar with creating a simple REST API with Express.

Convert the mock API you created into an Express app to successfully complete this task. You do not need to create an actual database -- use JSON objects in code instead.
